# Portfolio showing what I have acheived and learned on the Data Science PDA

This is a repository which demonstrates the skills I have learned whilst working towards The Professional Development Award in Data Science SQA level 8.

Data Analysis using Python and Excel

Excel 

In the Excel lessons I learned how to develop my existing skills in Excel and use it as a powerful tool to analyse and manipulate data to glean meaningful information.
Data collection
Data Cleaning - Removing duplicate values,Removing spaces Merging and splitting columns
Data Exploration (using Pivot Table) statistics
Data Visualization - Charts and dashboards



Limitations and why Python
Excel - limitations 
The built-in statistical analysis is too simple
NOt fast or efficient handling big data.

Pythonâ€™s libraries and frameworks allow it to work on Big Data.
Automating tasks - code created for Data analysud can be saved as scripts and be reused many times..
Deep learning and predictive models
